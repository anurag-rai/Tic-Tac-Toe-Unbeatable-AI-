			<u>WELCOME TO THE ABOUT PAGE OF THE SITE</u>
		</p>	
		<p>
            The site was created to simulate a <b>tic-tac-toe</b> game.
		</p>
        <p>
            Account has to be created to play the game. The score of the player is kept in records.
            A win means +1 point, loss is -1 and a draw does not change the score.
        </p>	
        <p>
            The Game can be played in two ways:
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Multi-Player mode</u> -  Here the person needs to have another human present by his/her side.
            The player logs into his/her accont, and only the score of the same is kept track of. The 
            other player who accompanies the account-holder in concern will not have his/her updated
            even if he/she has an account. The account-holder player makes the first move and the game
            proceeds so on.
        </p>
        <p>
           <u>Computer mode</u> - Here the players logs into his/her account and plays against the comptuer AI.
        The compter has been modelled "perfect". Here, perfect refers to resorting to the set of moves which
        always ends in either a draw, or loss for the player.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the course of the journey, the player has the option to reset his/her score. This will
            reinitialize his/her score to zero, irrespective of the previous value.
        </p>
        <p>
